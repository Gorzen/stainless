Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, callw11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, callw10a.txt

Etext produced by Ryan, Kirstin, Linda and Rick Trapp
In loving memory of Ivan Louis Reese

The equipment: a Compaq 486/33, a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet
IIc flatbed scanner; and Calera Word Scan Plus

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

Into the Primitive


         "Old longings nomadic leap,
          Chafing at custom's chain;
          Again from its brumal sleep
          Wakens the ferine strain." 

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that 
trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-
water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget 
Sound to San Diego.  Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, 
had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation 
companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing 
into the Northland.  These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they 
wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and 
furry coats to protect them from the frost. 

Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.  
Judge Miller's place, it was called.  It stood back from the road, 
half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be 
caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides.  
The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about 
through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of 
tall poplars.  At the rear things were on even a more spacious 
scale than at the front.  There were great stables, where a dozen 
grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, 
an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, 
green pastures, orchards, and berry patches.  Then there was the 
pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where 
Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the 
hot afternoon. 

And over this great demesne Buck ruled.  Here he was born, and 
here he had lived the four years of his life.  It was true, there 
were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a 
place, but they did not count.  They came and went, resided in the 
populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house 
after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the 
Mexican hairless,--strange creatures that rarely put nose out of 
doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox 
terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at 
Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected 
by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops. 

But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog.  The whole realm 
was his.  He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with 
the Judge's sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's 
daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry 
nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire; 
he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back, or rolled them in 
the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures 
down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where 
the paddocks were, and the berry patches.  Among the terriers he 
stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for 
he was king,--king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of 
Judge Miller's place, humans included. 

His father, Elmo, a huge St.  Bernard, had been the Judge's 
inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of 
his father.  He was not so large,--he weighed only one hundred and 
forty pounds,--for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd 
dog.  Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was 
added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, 
enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion.  During the 
four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated 
aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle 
egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of 
their insular situation.  But he had saved himself by not becoming 
a mere pampered house-dog.  Hunting and kindred outdoor delights 
had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to 
the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a 
health preserver. 

And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when 
the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen 
North.  But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know 
that Manuel, one of the gardener's helpers, was an undesirable 
acquaintance.  Manuel had one besetting sin.  He loved to play 
Chinese lottery.  Also, in his gambling, he had one besetting 
weakness--faith in a system; and this made his damnation certain.  
For to play a system requires money, while the wages of a 
gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous 
progeny. 

The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association, and 
the boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable 
night of Manuel's treachery.  No one saw him and Buck go off 
through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll.  
And with the exception of a solitary man, no one saw them arrive 
at the little flag station known as College Park.  This man talked 
with Manuel, and money chinked between them. 

"You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm," the stranger 
said gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around 
Buck's neck under the collar. 

"Twist it, an' you'll choke 'm plentee," said Manuel, and the 
stranger grunted a ready affirmative. 

Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity.  To be sure, it was 
an unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he 
knew, and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his 
own.  But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's 
hands, he growled menacingly.  He had merely intimated his 
displeasure, in his pride believing that to intimate was to 
command.  But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck, 
shutting off his breath.  In quick rage he sprang at the man, who 
met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft 
twist threw him over on his back.  Then the rope tightened 
mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling 
out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely.  Never in 
all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his 
life had he been so angry.  But his strength ebbed, his eyes 
glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two 
men threw him into the baggage car. 

The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting 
and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance.  
The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him 
where he was.  He had travelled too often with the Judge not to 
know the sensation of riding in a baggage car.  He opened his 
eyes, and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king.  
The man sprang for his throat, but Buck was too quick for him.  
His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they relax till his senses 
were choked out of him once more. 

"Yep, has fits," the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the 
baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle.  
"I'm takin' 'm up for the boss to 'Frisco.  A crack dog-doctor 
there thinks that he can cure 'm." 

rent babel.
